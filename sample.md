# Satish, who is a fitness consultant, would like his customers to use a simple app to determine the plan they can buy based on their weight and height inputs.
Based on the BMI calculated, the plans should be named as :

20<BMI<22: "Little UnderWeight"
22<BMI<25 : "Normal"
25<BMI<30 : "Little OverWeight"
BMI>30 : "Highly OverWeight"

Activity name should be 'MainActivity'
The EditText fields should have id's as 
Weight : 'etxtWeight'
Height : 'etxtHeight'

The Show Plan(s) button should have id as 'btnShowPlan'

The Text field containing the name of the plan should have id as 'txtPlanDetail'
